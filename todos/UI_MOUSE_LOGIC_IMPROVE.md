# UI: mouse, selection, drag and focus logic in Quire, Ledger and Lectern

Status (2026-10-13): all six phases and two review rounds are done: the audit is in tests/ui/ with no `todo` left,
`tools/older.mjs` runs the tests against older code; the data-loss items are fixed; every mouse drag goes through
`ui.drag`; each app has one owner per piece of state; the keyboard stays with the document (the focus rule); gestures
and focus are tested in each app's modes. Not finished until a check by hand in a real (headed) browser. Read docs/suite.md
(Shared code, Brushes) first. An audit of all three apps with real mouse and keyboard input (CDP, paced like a hand)
confirmed 45 defects; most come from the same few missing mechanisms (Root causes). Six phases, in order: 0 test
tools, 1 data loss, 2 one shared drag lifecycle, 3 one focus rule, 4 one owner per piece of state in each app,
5 the rest. Mark each task when it is done and verified (its regression test fails on the previous commit).

## Tasks

Phase 0: test tools (the user, 2026-10-12: automated on the local Chromium, no CI)
- [x] `tests/lib/input.mjs`: a tab on an app with real input (click, drag, double-click, right-click, keys, Esc, a lost
      release, window blur, tab switch), the brush cursor and console checks; it starts the server, and a headless
      local Chromium when nothing listens on 9222
- [x] `tests/ui/`: the audit as tests, one per defect (its id first in the name), each asserting what Office does and
      marked `todo` until it is fixed (taking the mark off is part of the fix, so the test becomes its regression
      test and the todo count is this plan's progress); the painter and Quire mouse tests move here.
      `node --test --test-concurrency=1 tests/ui/*.test.mjs`
- [x] The previous-code check as a script: `tools/older.mjs [REV] -- <tests>` runs today's tests against `public/` as at
      REV (default HEAD with uncommitted changes, else HEAD~1); docs/testing.md

Phase 1: data loss and wrong edits (small separate fixes, each with its test)
- [x] Q1 Quire: Find Next takes the keyboard from the Find box, the next Enter replaces the found text
- [x] Q2 Quire: Enter or Tab on a selected floating shape deletes it
- [x] Q3 Quire: dragging inside a template placeholder moves the placeholder's text
- [x] S3 Ledger: typing after going from the formula bar back into the cell is undone keystroke by keystroke
- [x] S7 Ledger: dragging a cell by its border onto data replaces it without asking
- [x] P1 Lectern: after a thumbnail click, a click on a shape and Delete delete the slide (arrows change slides)
- [x] P2 Lectern: formatting a selected range of table cells formats the whole table

Phase 2: one drag lifecycle, `ui.drag` in common/ui.js (Design)
- [x] `ui.drag` with `tests/ui/drag.test.mjs` (every app: threshold, Esc, right button, lost release, blur, tab switch)
- [x] Quire on it: rulers, table borders, drawing tool, shape move, resize, rotate, inline picture resize, splitter
      (Q13, Q14, Q17c)
- [x] Ledger on it: the grid's drags (cells, headers, fill, move, resize, page breaks, paint, point), shapes, sheet
      tabs (S12, S14c, S14d)
- [x] Lectern on it: move, handles, marquee, drawing tools, scribble, freeform and curve, text and cell selection,
      thumbnail reorder (P5, P14, P10)

Review follow-up (2026-10-12; reproduced with real input, still present at `3a899d3`)
- [x] R1 (P2, Phase 2, `09f1839`): Lectern's `liveEdit.commit` in `js/editor.js` records a drag after any keyboard
      edit made while the button is held, but its undo snapshot predates that edit. Resize a 120 × 80 rectangle,
      press Right before releasing, then release and Undo twice: the first Undo restores 120 × 80, the second
      brings back the resized dimensions with the undo stack empty. At `993f783`, two Undos restore the original
      rectangle. End or isolate a live drag before another edit records history; cover a nudge during resize as
      well as Ctrl+Z during resize (the earlier review covered only the latter).
      Done: while a drag's button is held, keys other than Esc, Ctrl+Z/Y and the modifiers go nowhere (`ui.drag`), so
      no edit comes between a drag's start and its step, in any app; tests R1 and drag.test's "other keys wait".
- [x] R2 (P2, Phase 1, `993f783`): Quire's Find result changes `E.sel` without clearing `E.objSel`
      (`A.gotoPos`'s `focus: false` path in `js/app.js`). Select a floating shape, Ctrl+F, find a word, Esc:
      the word is visibly selected, but typing is ignored and Right moves the old shape by 7.2 pt instead of
      moving the caret. The same sequence at `ac5652d` replaces the found word and leaves the shape alone.
      Make selecting a text match end the object selection; add this starting state to Q1's regression test.
      Done: `A.gotoPos` ends the object selection first; test R2 (Find searches from the shape's anchor, as Word).
- [x] R3 (P2, Phase 1, `993f783`): Quire's new `E.pressing()` gate in `js/templates.js` remains true after a
      release in another tab or a move reporting no held button. Press in ordinary text, release in another tab,
      return and use the arrow keys to enter a MACROBUTTON placeholder: its text is no longer selected for
      replacement until another click resets the flag. At `ac5652d` the keyboard still selects the whole field.
      Reset the press state on blur, pointer cancellation and a lost release without applying a cancelled brush.
      Done: Quire's editor drops the press on window blur, pointercancel and a move with no button held, without
      'sel-done'; tests R3 and R3b (a lost release paints nothing, the painter stays on).
- [x] R4 (P2, there before Phase 1; R2's twin, found by looking for the pattern): Ledger's `G.select`,
      `G.selectRange` and `G.selectAll` leave a selected drawing object selected; only a press on the grid deselects
      it. Select a shape, Ctrl+G, D5, Enter: D5 is selected, the shape too, and Delete deletes the shape. Find Next
      goes through the same `G.select`. Done: they drop the object first (`dropObject`); tests R4a (Go To), R4b (Find
      Next).

The pattern behind R1–R4 (2026-10-13): each came with a new path that skipped the one place keeping a rule (Root
causes 1, 3, 4 again), and each test began from nothing selected, had nothing in the middle and ended normally. So:
- [x] Each app's selection setter ends the other kinds (Quire `E.setSel` the object selection, Ledger `G.select` the
      object; Lectern's `E.select` already does: it ends text editing and `E.cellSel`) (Phase 4)
- [x] Each app's history push cancels a live drag first, a backstop for any edit that comes in the middle of one
      (Quire `D.tx`, Ledger `O.tx`, Lectern `L.hist.push`; safe: `ui.drag` is over before its `up` runs)
- [x] Press state outside `ui.drag`: Quire's text press runs as a `ui.drag` watching the browser's selection; the
      slide show's `st._down` resets on a lost release and on blur (Phase 5)
- [x] `tests/lib/gestures.mjs`: the states a gesture starts from, what comes in the middle and the ways out, as
      lists a gesture test runs through. Done: `tests/ui/gestures.test.mjs` runs five drags through them (115 cases);
      at `3a899d3` 47 fail (keys acted in the middle of a drag: R1's class), with R1's fix none

Phase 3: one focus rule, the keyboard back to the document (Design)
- [x] ui.js dialogs hand the keyboard back through `ui.hooks.refocus()` (Q6 first half, P7)
- [x] ui.js menus don't take focus; a command chosen from a menu hands it back (Q6 second half)
- [x] Chrome without a control of its own keeps the focus where it is (S11)
- [x] Each app's `refocus` puts the model selection back into the page (Quire, Ledger, Lectern)
- [x] `tests/ui/focus.test.mjs`: dialogs (OK, Cancel, Esc) from a menu, a toolbar and the context menu; menu commands;
      chrome backgrounds; in every app and in Classic and Paper 2016

Phase 4: one owner per piece of state
- [x] Quire object selection: one way in and out of it (Q15, Q10)
- [x] Quire model selection at gesture ends (Q9, Q11)
- [x] Quire header and footer editing (Q7, Q8)
- [x] Lectern: one end-the-interaction path; the Slides pane and the slide own their focus (P3, P4)
- [x] Lectern selection on press, shift-click, the edit ring, the scroll bar, double-click (P6, P11, P12, P13)
- [x] Lectern table cells (P8, P9)
- [x] Ledger cell editor: one way to leave an edit; point mode as Excel (S1, S5, S6, S10, S14b)
- [x] Ledger selection extent (S2); shape text then a cell (S4)
- [x] No re-render under the pointer on press (S8; P4 above)

Phase 5: the rest
- [x] Quire text drag and drop (Q4, Q5); the Drag-and-drop text editing option; dragging inline pictures (Q17a, Q17b)
- [x] Quire selection bar (Q12); a drag from a table out to text (Q16)
- [x] Ledger auto-scroll (S9, S13); holding the button on a hyperlink (S14a)
- [x] Lectern: check the two open questions against PowerPoint (Audit, Lectern, Open)
- [x] P15 Lectern: "Click to add first slide" does nothing
- [x] docs: docs/suite.md (Drags, Selections, Focus), docs/ledger.md (point mode), docs/testing.md (gestures, focus, a
      Chromium per port); docs/quire.md and docs/lectern.md describe no mouse behaviour to update

## To do from the mode-test review (2026-10-13)

- [x] P2: Lectern's new 150 % gesture mode does not reset "nothing selected" between cases.
      `tests/ui/gestures.test.mjs` uses `slideBlank`, which returns (356, 1121) in the 1280 × 800 test viewport;
      the click is outside the viewport and hits nothing. After the first release and Undo, `L.ed.sel` still
      contains `rectR`, so the subsequent cancellation cases pass from a selected shape instead of their named
      starting state. Use a visible, hit-tested background point and assert the selection/editing state after
      each start. Reproduced against `1900bd3` plus the pending mode tests with
      `/tmp/vibeoffice-review-mode-start.test.mjs`: the second case fails the starting-selection assertion.
      Done: `slideBlank` hit-tests a point of the slide's background where the slide area shows it; every starting
      state has a `check` the case asserts before its drag, and the drag's points must be on screen.

## What was done

- 2026-10-12 (1035247), the Format Painter: `ui.brush` (common/ui.js) is the mode every painter and Quire's highlighter
  uses, and applies once when the mouse is let go; Quire's editor says when a gesture is over (`'sel-done'`) and ends
  an object selection one way (`E.clearObjSel`, which drawing.js follows); Lectern's painter keeps the text being
  edited. `tests/ui/painter.test.mjs`, `tests/ui/quire.test.mjs`. This plan follows the same pattern.

- 2026-10-12, Phase 1, each test passing now and failing on the code before:
  - Q1 Find and Replace keeps the keyboard: `A.gotoPos(…, { focus: false })` sets the model's selection only and draws it
    (`E.drawSel`, the `quire-sel` highlight), because Chrome focuses the editable page a selection lands in; Replace
    keeps the keyboard on its button; closing the dialog puts the found text back as the page's selection.
  - Q2 Enter and Tab do nothing while a floating object is selected (its anchor is the text selection).
  - Q3 a template placeholder is selected when the mouse is let go (`'sel-done'`) or the caret is moved into it, not
    while the button is down (`E.pressing()`).
  - S3 the cell editor's input takes the edit back from the formula bar on press and focus.
  - S7 a dragged range dropped on cells holding data asks first (`L.clip.holdsData`); onto empty cells it just moves.
  - P1 a press on the slide takes the keyboard from the Slides pane.
  - P2 formatting keeps the selected range of table cells through the edit's detach, and the range stays selected.
  Tests added beside them: Replace one match at a time, a click on a placeholder, a drop onto empty cells, a second
  command on the same cells.

- 2026-10-12, Phase 2: `ui.drag` (common/ui.js, `tests/ui/drag.test.mjs`): `cancel(d, why)` says why ('esc',
  'button', 'lost', 'blur', 'new', 'api'); `capture: false` for drags over CSS-scaled text the browser selects; the
  held pointer sends the click and dblclick that follow to the capture element. Every mouse drag of the three apps is
  on it: Quire's shape move, resize and rotate, inline picture resize, the drawing tool, table borders and the pencil,
  the rulers, the splitters; Ledger's grid drags (cells, headers, fill, move, sizes, page breaks, paint, point; a
  cancel puts the selection or the formula back), shapes, the AutoShapes draw, sheet-tab reorder, the splitter;
  Lectern's move, handles, crop, marquee, drawing tools, scribble, freeform and curve, text and cell selection,
  thumbnail and sorter reorder, splitters. A tool, view, slide or zoom switch ends a live drag (`ui.dragCancel`), and
  an unfinished freeform goes with a tool switch. Left as they are: Ledger's touch gestures, Lectern's slide-show pen.
  Q13, Q14a–c, Q17c, S12a–c, S14c–d, P5a–f, P10, P14 off todo, each failing before; tests added for drags that must
  still commit (Quire's shapes, pictures, drawing tool, ruler, table border).
- 2026-10-12, an outside review of Phase 2 (09f1839), each finding reproduced, fixed and tested (the tests fail on
  09f1839): Esc in the middle of a drag left the Format Painter on (Ledger, Lectern) and Lectern's drawing tool armed;
  now Esc also puts a brush down and ends the tool in every app, the other cancels keep a tool armed. Ctrl+Z in the
  middle of a Lectern resize undid the move before it and Ctrl+Y brought back the uncommitted resize; now Ctrl+Z or
  Ctrl+Y in the middle of any drag cancels the drag only. A right-click within 1.5 s of a middle-button cancel opened
  no menu; the swallowing is for the cancelling button's own click only. Also: the press's cursor stays during a drag
  (the held pointer showed the cursor of the element holding it); Ledger's sheet switch, zoom and a new workbook end a
  live drag. Not changed: a drag under 4 px does nothing (the threshold, on purpose).

- 2026-10-13, R4, the pattern behind R1–R4 and Phases 4 and 5 (Phase 3, the focus rule, still open), each test
  failing at `3a899d3` and passing now; one worker per app, each on a Chromium of its own:
  - The pattern: one selection setter per app ends the other kinds (Quire `E.setSel` the object selection, with
    `E.selectObject` the one way in; Ledger `G.select`, `selectRange`, `selectAll` a drawing object, R4); each app's
    history push cancels a live drag first; Quire's text press is a `ui.drag` that watches the browser's selection
    (`{ capture: false, cursor: false }`; `cursor: false` is new in `ui.drag`), so every way out of it is `ui.drag`'s;
    the slide show's press resets on a lost release and blur. `tests/lib/gestures.mjs` and `tests/ui/gestures.test.mjs`.
  - Quire: Q15 (a floating shape selected leaves no text highlighted: the page holds a hidden caret at its anchor),
    Q10 (a right-click selects the object, or keeps it selected), Q9 and Q11 (the browser's selection read first), Q7
    (the part of the page not being edited takes no caret), Q8a–d (the header opens on the page clicked, closes back to
    the selection before or the point double-clicked, and an empty one opens from the margin), Q12a–c (the selection
    bar: drag by lines, Shift extends, triple-click selects all), Q16 (from a table out to the text: whole rows,
    removed with Delete), Q4 and Q5 (drag and drop: forgotten on `dragend`, a drop must carry our mark; `moveRange`),
    Q17a (the Drag-and-drop text editing option), Q17b (inline pictures, shapes and charts move by drag, with a drop
    caret; Ctrl copies, Esc puts back). `T.removeRows` in tables.js.
  - Ledger: S1a–c and S14b (point mode also in Edit mode where the formula expects an operand; Shift+click extends the
    last reference), S2a–c (the extent resets with every new selection; Shift+Arrow keeps whole columns or rows
    whole), S4 (shape text finished doesn't reselect a deselected shape), S5a–b and S6 (one `end()` for every way out
    of an edit, back to the formula's sheet; a right-click and the Name Box enter the typing first), S8 (sheet tabs
    updated in place, the reorder drag captured by the tab: double-click renames), S9a–b and S13a–b (auto-scroll
    re-reads the frame each step and leaves frozen panes alone), S10a–b (the Alt+Down list takes its keys and its
    outside-press listener goes with it), S14a (a hyperlink held 1 s selects the cell instead).
  - Lectern: `E.endInteraction()` (a tool switch, another slide, undo); P3 (a thumbnail press ends text editing), P4a–c
    (the Slides pane keeps the keyboard when drawn again; a thumbnail is refreshed in place), toolbars that come with
    a selection wait for the press to end (and a double-click's time), so the slide doesn't move under the pointer;
    P6a–b (Shift or Ctrl adds to the selection, never edits), P11 (a click on the edit ring selects the box), P12a–b
    (the scroll bars only scroll), P13 (double-click selects the word in an unselected shape), P8 and P9 (a press in a
    table cell edits it and a drag selects cells; the table moves by its border; a press in one cell ends the range),
    P15 (Click to add first slide). Open questions, decided as Impress does: a thumbnail let go over the slide moves no
    slide; typing over a cell range goes into the cell the drag started in and ends the range, Delete empties the
    range's cells (one step).
  - The full set after it: tests/ui 281 tests, 269 pass, 12 `todo` (Q6a–d, S11a–d, P7a–d: Phase 3), 0 fail; Ledger's
    unit tests 79, Quire's 29, ribbon and looks 7, all pass.

- 2026-10-13, Phase 3, the focus rule (common/ui.js): a press on chrome with no control of its own, on a menu, the
  menu bar or a button outside a dialog keeps the keyboard where it is (one `mousedown` listener); a dialog closing
  gives it back to what had it, except text being edited, which goes through `ui.hooks.refocus()` with the app's
  selection; a menu command that leaves the keyboard nowhere calls `refocus()`; Lectern's refocus gives the Slides
  pane its keyboard back. Q6a–d, S11a–d, P7a–d off todo; a test for a dialog over the Slides pane;
  `tests/ui/focus.test.mjs` (75 cases, three apps, Classic and Paper 2016; 55 fail at `3a899d3`). The full set after
  it: tests/ui 357 tests, all pass, no `todo` left; ribbon and looks 7 pass.

- 2026-10-13, an outside review of `d69ae57`, four regressions reproduced with real input, each test failing at
  `d69ae57`: (1) Q16's row deletion bypassed Track Changes (Reject All left the table gone): tracked, the selection is
  deleted as text (rows can't be marked deleted); (2) a tracked move dropped later in its paragraph landed short
  (`moveRange` assumed the source physically went): the drop point is counted from the paragraph's end; (3) a dialog
  over Lectern's speaker notes gave the keyboard to the slide: a dialog gives editable text back with the selection it
  had, unless it is the document's own (`ui.hooks.ownsText`: Quire's page, Lectern's slide), which `refocus()` gives
  back; (4) the thumbnail's star after an edit previewed on the detached thumbnail (`refreshThumb` moves the star):
  it uses the thumbnail it is in. Tests: Q5 tracked, Q16 tracked, the speaker notes and Print, the star after an edit.

- 2026-10-13, the modes the tests had skipped (both review rounds found faults only there): `tests/lib/gestures.mjs`
  and `tests/ui/gestures.test.mjs` run each drag briefly in its app's modes (Quire Track Changes and 150 %; Ledger
  frozen panes, the second sheet, 150 %; Lectern a slide with a transition, the second slide, the Outline tab, 150 %),
  `tests/ui/focus.test.mjs` the dialogs, menus and chrome presses in them (Quire Track Changes, a header, Outline view;
  Ledger frozen panes, the second sheet, 150 %; Lectern the speaker notes, the Slides pane, a transition). All pass;
  the speaker-notes mode fails at `d69ae57`, as the review found. No new fault: one apparent one was the test turning
  Track Changes on without its command (the Reviewing toolbar then came with the first edit). Checked: Ctrl+PageUp and
  Ctrl+PageDown never reach a page in a Chrome tab (Chrome switches tabs), so they can't work after the tab's menu
  either; the arrow keys do (test).

- 2026-10-13, found by the user in a headed Chromium: (1) Quire's diagrams (and any group's shapes) could not take
  a caret: a click on "Level 2" put it at the start of the paragraph the diagram is in, and typing went there (there
  since before this plan). The document index skipped groups' text boxes (`D.reindex` asked for the group's own `tb`,
  which a group never has); now each shape's text in a group is a story, edited and saved. (2) The move cursor where a
  drag moves: Quire's pictures, shapes and diagrams (their text keeps the text cursor; none in the part of the page
  not being edited), and a selected Lectern group's or diagram's frame, whose edge (`.grp-ring`) now moves it as
  the edit ring does. Tests: a diagram's labels take a caret (and save), the move cursor in Quire, a diagram's frame
  in Lectern; each fails at `bec8055`.

## Decisions

- A release we never saw (button let go in another tab or window) cancels the drag, as a lost mouse capture does in
  Windows and in LibreOffice (vcl ends tracking with Cancel); it doesn't commit at the last point. (The user,
  2026-10-12)

- `ui.drag` lives in common/ui.js, next to `ui.brush` (the focus rule has to, it changes ui.js's dialogs and menus);
  no script lists change. (The user, 2026-10-12)

- Office is the guide, not a spec to match exactly: the aim is a fluent experience, the same in all three apps.
  Where Office's exact behaviour is unknown or awkward, choose what feels fluent and consistent (the tests P5f, Q17c
  and S14d, a right-click during a drag cancels it and opens no menu; Q8b, Esc out of the header puts the caret back
  in the body; S5a, a right-click on another cell commits the typing first, are such choices). (The user, 2026-10-12)

Proposed, to settle with the user before Phase 2:
- The order of the phases is the one above (data loss first); the user has not confirmed it yet.

## Root causes

1. No shared drag lifecycle. Each drag adds its own window listeners; none has a movement threshold, and none ends
   on Esc, a second button, a lost release, `pointercancel`, window blur or a tool switch. (Phase 2)
2. No single way to hand the keyboard back to the document. Dialogs restore the element focused before them, which is
   `<body>` or an editor whose selection they moved; menus take the focus and keep it; chrome backgrounds drop it;
   a modeless dialog's command takes it from the dialog. (Phase 3)
3. Selections held twice and synced by hand: object against text selection (Quire's `E.sel` set to the anchor
   without the page, Lectern's text edit against `E.sel`, Ledger's shape against the cell), and the model selection
   against the page's (read before `selectionchange` has run). (Phase 4)
4. State set on one path and cleared only on the normal one: Ledger's selection extent and its cell editor (which
   input it reads, its sheet, its mode), Lectern's `focusArea`, `E.cellSel` and freeform points, Quire's
   header/footer mode, re-renders on press that take the element under the pointer. (Phase 4)

## Design

### `ui.drag(e, opts)`: one drag at a time (common/ui.js)

`ui.drag(e, { move(ev, d), up(ev, d), cancel(d), threshold = 4, capture })` starts on a primary-button press and
returns the drag `d` (`d.x0`, `d.y0`, `d.moved`, `d.data` for the app):
- One at a time (`ui.dragging()`); a new press while one is live cancels the old one first.
- `move` is called only after the pointer has gone `threshold` px from the press (Windows' drag rectangle is 4 px);
  `up` gets `d.moved`, so a click that never moved changes nothing (rulers, tab stops, rotate) or does its click.
- It ends with `up` on the release of the same pointer, with pointer capture on `capture` (default the press target).
- It ends with `cancel` (nothing commits; the app restores what it moved) on: Esc (capture-phase keydown, before the
  app's own Esc, which then doesn't run), a second button (its `contextmenu` is swallowed), a move that reports no
  button held (`ev.buttons === 0`), `lostpointercapture`, `pointercancel`, window blur, the page hidden, a tool or
  view switch (`ui.dragCancel()`).
- Text selection drags stay native (the browser's); apps keep their own "gesture over" signal (Quire `'sel-done'`).
- Auto-scroll stays with the app, but its timer re-reads the current frame on every tick (S9).
- Reference: LibreOffice's vcl tracking (`Window::StartTracking`, `EndTracking(TrackingEventFlags::Cancel)`), read
  in vcl/source/window/winproc.cxx: Esc ends tracking with `Cancel | Key` and goes no further, losing the focus
  (`ImplHandleLoseFocus`) cancels it, the release of any button ends it. The difference: a second button cancels here,
  so no menu opens in the middle of a drag (fluent first). The drag threshold is MouseSettings' StartDragWidth/Height
  there, 4 px here.
- Pointer events report a second button as a move (`buttons` changes), before its mouse events: ui.drag cancels on
  that move and swallows the button's mousedown, mouseup and contextmenu for a moment.

### The keyboard back to the document (common/ui.js)

When a piece of chrome is done, the keyboard goes back to the document through the app's `ui.hooks.refocus()`, which
puts the model selection back into the page (Quire `E.refocus`, Lectern the text being edited at `L.te.lastSel` or
the slide, Ledger the grid or the cell editor's input):
- A dialog closing (OK, Cancel, Esc): `refocus()`, unless the element focused before it is a chrome control that is
  still there (a pane's box), which gets the focus back (ui.js:358, :422 today restore it always).
- Menus: rows `preventDefault` on press, as toolbar buttons do, so the menu never takes the focus (ui.js:110, :128);
  a command chosen from a menu that opens no dialog ends with `refocus()`.
- Chrome without a control of its own (toolbar and ribbon backgrounds, grips, status bar, tab strips, the Name Box
  frame): one press listener in ui.js keeps the focus where it is.
- A modeless dialog (Find and Replace) keeps the focus while it is open: what it runs moves the selection without
  focusing the page (Quire `A.gotoPos(pos, { focus: false })`).
- Reference: vcl's `Window::GrabFocusToDocument()`, which toolbars and dialogs use to give the focus back.

### One owner per piece of state (each app)

Quire
- Object selection: `E.selectObject(os)` and `E.clearObjSel()` are the only writers of `E.objSel`. Selecting an object
  clears the page's text selection (no highlight left, Q15), and keys go through the object guard before anything
  else (Enter and Tab today run first, Q2). `DR.select` and `selectInlineObject` use it.
- The model selection at a gesture's end: code that runs right after a pointer event calls `E.syncSel()` first
  (context menu Q9, Ctrl+click Q11) or listens to `'sel-done'` instead of `'sel'` (templates Q3).
- Header and footer editing: the selection stays in the story being edited (Q7); opening and closing keep the view
  and the caret (Q8).

Lectern
- `E.endInteraction()`: cancels the live drag (`ui.dragCancel`), unfinished freeform points (`ff`), `E.cellSel` and its
  overlay; called by Esc, `E.setTool`, a slide change, a re-render and window blur.
- Focus: a press on the slide takes the focus for the slide (`focusArea = 'slide'`, P1); a re-render of the Slides
  pane keeps the focus on the same thumbnail (P4); a thumbnail click always ends text editing (P3).

Ledger
- The cell editor: one `leave(commit)` for every way out (Enter, Tab, Esc, a click on another cell, a right-click, the
  Name Box, a sheet tab, a toolbar command); the formula bar and the cell are two views of one edit, whichever has the
  focus (S3, S5, S6). Point mode as Excel: wherever a reference can go, in Enter and Edit mode, from the cell or the
  bar, Shift extends it (S1, S14b).
- The selection: `G.select`, `G.selectRange` and header clicks reset the extent Shift+Arrow grows from (S2).

## Audit (2026-10-12, on 1035247)

Each item: what the user does, what happens (against what Office does), the cause (lines as of 1035247; they drift).
Probes are in `tmp/audit-quire/`, `tmp/audit-ledger/`, `tmp/audit-lectern/` (`node <file>`; tmp is not kept: the
steps here are enough to rebuild them). Reproduced again by hand: Q1, Q2, S1, S2, P1, P2; the rest by the auditors.

### Quire

- Q1 Ctrl+F, type "beta", Enter (found), Enter again: the found "beta" becomes a paragraph break. Word finds the next.
  `find.js:350` calls `A.gotoPos` (`app.js:972-974`), which focuses the page. (p25-find-focus)
- Q2 Click a floating shape, press Enter or Tab: the shape is deleted; `objSel` still points at it, so letters typed
  next vanish. Word keeps it. Enter and Tab are handled at `editor.js:687/697`, before the object guard at `:746`;
  `DR.select` set `E.sel` to the anchor (`drawing.js:532`). (p06-shape-enter)
- Q3 In a document from a template, press inside a [Click here…] placeholder and drag: the placeholder's text moves
  ("Dear , thank you fo[Click here…]r…", undo "Move"). The `'sel'` listener (`templates.js:260-271`) selects the
  field while the button is down, so Chrome starts a text drag. (p22-macrobutton-drag)
- Q4 Drag selected text and drop it outside the document, then drop other text (e.g. from the font box): the old
  selection moves. `dragData` (`editor.js:805-807`) is never cleared; there is no `dragend`. (p13-dnd-stale)
- Q5 Drag a word forward within its paragraph: the caret lands the word's length too far right. `editor.js:836-837`
  returns the end from before the source is deleted. (p23-dnd-same-para)
- Q6 Ctrl+D, then Esc or OK: the selection goes to the end of the document and typing goes there (`ui.js:422` focuses
  the page without the selection). A menu-bar command chosen with the mouse (View ▸ Ruler, or a dialog from a menu,
  closed) leaves the focus on `<body>`: the menu (`ui.js:110`, tabindex -1) takes it because its rows don't
  `preventDefault` (`:128`). (p11-dialog-menu-focus, p30-menu-focus)
- Q7 Editing the header, click the dimmed body: the caret goes into the body; Enter, Delete and Backspace edit it while
  letters vanish. `E.onSelectionChange` (`editor.js:~95-112`) takes body positions while `LY.hfEdit` is set.
  (p17-hf-body-keys)
- Q8 Opening the header on page 2 scrolls to page 1 and puts the caret at the header's start (`app.js:940`); closing
  it (Esc, double-click) puts the caret at the document's start (`app.js:966`); double-clicking the top margin when
  the header is empty does nothing (its box is 0 high, `editor.js:938`). (p15-hf, p16-hf-click-body, p33-hf-close)
- Q9 Caret outside a table, right-click a cell: no table items; a second right-click has them. `contextmenu` comes
  before `selectionchange`; `A.contextMenu` (`app.js:1002-1004`) doesn't `E.syncSel()`. (p08-ctxmenu-caret)
- Q10 Right-click a selected inline picture: the handles go while it stays selected. Right-click an unselected one:
  it isn't selected, so no picture items. `hideHandles()` runs before the button check (`editor.js:855-856`).
  (p07-picture-rclick)
- Q11 Ctrl+click a sentence: the sentence at the old caret is selected. The `setTimeout(0)` (`editor.js:889`) reads
  `E.sel` before it is updated. (p02-ctrlclick)
- Q12 Selection bar (left margin): a drag down selects only the first line; Shift+click doesn't extend (`selectLine`
  resets, `editor.js:901/908`); a triple-click selects the paragraph, not the document (`:881`). (p01-selbar,
  p21-clicks)
- Q13 A click without movement on the left-indent marker moves it 25 → 27 pt, on a tab stop 100 → 103.5 pt, each an
  undo step that marks the document changed; a click on the rotate handle adds a "Rotate" step. No movement check
  (`rulers.js:220-224`, `drawing.js:664`). (p09-ruler-rotate-click)
- Q14 Esc during a drag doesn't cancel: drawing a shape still inserts it despite "Press Esc to cancel"
  (`drawtool.js:58/96`); a shape move still moves (`drawing.js:578`); an inline picture resize still resizes
  (`editor.js:983`). (p20-draw-esc, p19-shape-drag-esc, p24-picture-resize)
- Q15 Select text, then click a floating shape: the text stays highlighted; Ctrl+B records "Bold" on the hidden
  anchor. `DR.select` sets `E.sel` without the page (`drawing.js:525-532`). (p27-shape-text-sel)
- Q16 Drag from a table cell down into the text below: 3 of 4 cells are highlighted, and Delete leaves an empty table
  shell where Word removes the rows. The `markCells` else branch in editor.js. (p35-table-out-delete)
- Q17 (a) Tools ▸ Options ▸ Drag-and-drop text editing does nothing (`opts.dragDrop` is never read,
  p14-dragdrop-option); (b) inline pictures can't be dragged to another place (p31-picture-drag); (c) a right-click
  during a shape move opens the menu and the move still happens on release (p19).

Working as Word does: drag-select out of the window and back, auto-scroll, the page gap; toolbar buttons, the font
boxes and palettes keep the selection; window blur; table border resize and table drag-select. Chrome on Linux
selects a double-clicked word without its space (Word includes it): not ours.

### Ledger

- S1 F2 or a double-click, type `=1+`, click C3: "The formula you typed contains an error" (also typing in the formula
  bar). Excel inserts C3. Edit mode never goes to point mode (`editor.js:19`, `:128`, `:199`); only point mode
  inserts references (`grid.js:444`). (p01-edit-mode-point, p01b-formula-bar-point)
- S2 A1, Shift+Down twice, Down, Shift+Right: A2:B3 (Excel A2:B2). Drag B2:D5, click F10, Shift+Down: D6:F10. Click
  column H, Shift+Right: E1:H5. `s.extent` (`grid.js:245`) is never cleared by `G.select`, `G.selectRange` or header
  clicks; `G.move` (`grid.js:302`) and PageDown start from it. (p24-stale-extent)
- S3 Double-click A5, click the formula bar, click back into the cell and type: each keystroke is undone. Only the bar
  sets `surface` (`editor.js:24`; not reset at `:32`), so `E.onInput` (`editor.js:197`) copies the bar over the
  cell. (p02-surfaces)
- S4 Edit a shape's text, then click a cell: the shape is selected again and typing goes into it. The blur runs
  `finish()` (`drawing.js:329`), whose `replace()` reselects the shape (`drawing.js:217`) after `grid.js:438`
  deselected it. (p12-shape-text-then-cell)
- S5 Typing in A1, right-click C5: the selection moves to C5 with no menu, and Enter writes A1 and goes to C6
  (`grid.js:426` acts before the edit is committed). Typing in A2, type C5 in the Name Box: C5 is selected while
  typing still goes to A2 (`app.js:664` only selects the box's text). The font boxes commit first through
  `ui.hooks.commitEdit` (`common/ui.js:287`). (p25-rightclick-while-editing, p04-namebox-while-editing)
- S6 Type `=`, click Sheet2, click B2, Enter: Ledger stays on Sheet2 and moves its selection; Excel goes back to
  Sheet1 and moves to A2. `end()` (`editor.js:328`) doesn't go back to `E.sheet`; `moveAfter` (`editor.js:353`).
  (p03-sheet-point)
- S7 Drag a cell by its border onto a cell with data: replaced without asking (Excel asks). The comment at
  `clipboard.js:411` says it asks; nothing does. (p08-drag-ops a)
- S8 Double-click a sheet tab (active or not): Rename never opens. Each press re-renders the tabs (`app.js:317` →
  `renderTabs`, `app.js:306`), so neither click nor dblclick reaches them. (p10-sheet-tabs, p10b-tab-dblclick-events)
- S9 Drag column headers past the edge: it scrolls 20 columns but stays C:T. The frame is captured once
  (`grid.js:526`) and the timer (`grid.js:512`) hit-tests it again (`grid.js:531-532`). (p06-autoscroll)
- S10 Alt+Down on a cell, or a validation list: arrows move the cell, Enter moves down, Esc doesn't close it, the
  list stays. `E.listKey` (`editor.js:569`) is never called; its outside-click listener (`:565-566`) is never
  removed. (p22-picklist-keys)
- S11 Click a toolbar or ribbon background, a grip, the Name Box frame, the empty tab strip or the status bar (16 of
  16 areas, in every look): the focus goes to `<body>`; arrows, Delete and F2 do nothing until a cell is clicked
  (only letters recover, `app.js:774`). (p20-focus-sweep, p05b-blank-chrome, p27-chrome-buttons)
- S12 A drag whose release was lost (moves reporting no button): the selection or the fill outline follows the bare
  pointer, the fill outline stays after the next click, and a shape's move outline follows and is dropped by the next
  click ("Move Object"). Drags end only on pointerup and pointercancel (`grid.js:499-501`, `drawing.js:279`).
  (p15-lost-release, p15b-lost-release-fill, p15c-lost-release-shape)
- S13 Frozen panes: a drag inside the frozen rows or column scrolls the other pane by itself (row 32 back to 18 in
  0.8 s); `grid.js:509-510` treats the frozen area as above or left of it. (p14-frozen)
- S14 (a) Holding the button on a hyperlink still follows it on release; Excel selects the cell (`grid.js:690`,
  p16-link-hold). (b) Shift+click in point mode replaces the reference (`=D5`, not `=B2:D5`; only Ctrl is passed,
  `grid.js:447`, p17-point-shift-click). (c) Esc during a fill-handle drag doesn't cancel it (p08-drag-ops b).
  (d) A right-click during a left drag opens the context menu (`onContext`, `grid.js:793`, p08-drag-ops c).

Working as Excel does: dialogs and the focus after them, ribbon tabs, buttons and boxes, column and row resize and
AutoFit, several ranges, a release outside the window, shapes (move, resize, Esc). Not confirmed: the comment pop-up
staying after the pointer leaves the grid (`grid.js:1040` listens for `pointerleave` on `document`); native scroll
bars (headless Chrome's don't behave like real ones).

### Lectern

- P1 Click a thumbnail, click a shape on the slide, press Delete: the whole slide is deleted; arrows change slides
  instead of nudging. PowerPoint moves the keyboard to the slide. `onDown` calls `preventDefault` (`editor.js:400`),
  so the focus stays in the Slides pane; `E.refocus` returns early while `focusArea === 'slides'` (`editor.js:56`);
  `app.js:1799` sends the keys to the slides. (p01-thumb-focus-delete)
- P2 Drag-select 2×2 cells of a 3×3 table, click Bold or Center: all 9 cells change. `F.run` and `F.para` call
  `TE.detach()` (`textedit.js:813`, `:829`), which sets `E.cellSel = null` (`textedit.js:387`) before `forEachTx`
  reads it (`textedit.js:802`). (p13-table-range-format)
- P3 Editing text, click the current slide's thumbnail: editing stays (its ring); Delete and typing do nothing,
  Ctrl+B formats the hidden selection and pulls the focus back, the next Delete deletes text. `panes.js:95` calls
  `goto` (which ends editing) only when the slide changes; `app.js:1771` handles text keys before the pane.
  (p05-edit-then-elsewhere)
- P4 In the Slides pane, Delete a slide or drag one to another place: the focus goes to `<body>` and `focusArea` to
  null, so a second Delete does nothing. `L.clear(LP.body)` (`panes.js:50`) removes the focused thumbnail; its blur
  clears `focusArea` (`panes.js:26`). (p16-thumb-delete-twice, p15-thumb-reorder-focus)
- P5 Esc during a move, a resize, drawing a rectangle or reordering slides: it still commits on release (Esc only
  deselects); during a scribble it throws (`TypeError`, `editor.js:846`, `E.tool` null). A right-click during a move
  deselects and opens the slide's menu, and the move commits. The private `drag` (`editor.js:352`, `730-732`) has no
  cancel; the Esc handler (`app.js:1790`) doesn't know it. (p02-escape-during-drag, p14-thumb-drag, p17-misc)
- P6 Shift+click or Ctrl+click a text box: the selection is dropped and the box is edited. `startMove`'s up
  (`editor.js:492-494`) starts editing text boxes with Shift or Ctrl held; `TE.begin` resets `E.sel`
  (`textedit.js:327`). (p11-shift-click-textboxes)
- P7 Format ▸ Font… from a menu or the context menu, then Cancel or Esc: the focus is on `<body>` while the ring still
  shows; typing is lost. Hyperlink from the toolbar, Cancel: the caret goes to the text's start. `ui.js:358`, `:422`
  restore the element focused before, never `ui.hooks.refocus()`. (p07-dialog-cancel)
- P8 Drag across the cells of a table that isn't being edited: the table moves (PowerPoint selects the cells).
  `startCellSelect` runs only while the table is edited (`editor.js:381`). (p04-table-drag a)
- P9 Select a range of cells, click one cell: the range's highlight stays, formatting then hits the one cell.
  `editor.js:727` clears `E.cellSel` without redrawing the overlay. (p04-table-drag b)
- P10 Start a Freeform, switch to Rectangle: the freeform's ghost line stays, and the next Freeform carries the old
  points. `E.setTool` (`editor.js:759`) doesn't drop `ff`. (p03-freeform-switch-tool)
- P11 Editing text, click the hatched edit ring: editing restarts with the caret at the end (PowerPoint 2003 selects
  the box as an object, and Delete removes it). `editor.js:528` sends it to `startMove`, whose up starts editing.
  (p12-ring-scrollbar a)
- P12 Zoomed in, press the scroll bar: editing ends and everything is deselected; `editor.js:392-398` takes a press on
  the scroller for a press on the slide's background. (p12-ring-scrollbar b, c)
- P13 Double-click a word in an unselected AutoShape: a caret, not the word. The second press starts editing without
  word selection, then `onDbl` skips because editing is on (`editor.js:746`). (p08-dblclick-word)
- P14 Start a move, switch tabs and let go there, come back: the shape follows the pointer with no button held.
  `editor.js:730` calls `drag.move` without looking at `e.buttons`; nothing ends it on blur or a lost capture.
  (p19-drag-tab-switch)

- P15 (found by the Phase 2 review, there before it) "Click to add first slide" in an empty presentation does
  nothing: the click goes to the element holding the pointer (`E.scroller`).

Working as PowerPoint does: text drag-select out of the box and the window and back, margin drags, Shift+click in
text, the marquee (also released outside the window), Bold, the size, font and zoom boxes and their lists, menus
dismissed, the notes pane, window blur while editing, groups (drill-in, Esc). Open: a thumbnail dragged and let go over
the slide still reorders; typing over a cell range goes into the anchor cell and the highlight stays. Not testable:
Ctrl+T never reaches the page in Chrome (the Font dialog is reached from menus).

## Working rules

- Real input only: CDP `Input` events paced like a hand (40-60 ms between moves, ~300 ms after a release); synthetic
  DOM events hide exactly these bugs. Assert what the user sees (the cursor, the text, the formatting, where typing
  goes), so a test also runs against the previous code.
- A fix's regression test fails on the previous commit (`node tools/older.mjs -- <its test>`); say so in the commit
  message.
- Fluent first, Office as the guide (Decisions): behave as Office does where it is known and good; when unsure, read
  how LibreOffice does it (vcl tracking and focus, sw edtwin, sc gridwin, sd fu*.cxx), and otherwise choose what
  feels fluent and is the same in all three apps.
- A change in common/ (`ui.drag`, the focus rule) is checked in all three apps and in the Classic and Paper 2016
  looks (`node --test tests/ribbon.test.mjs tests/looks.test.mjs`), with screenshots of what it touches.
- Each phase ends with the full set: `node --test --test-concurrency=1 tests/ui/*.test.mjs` (no new failures; the todo count only
  goes down), the apps' unit tests, and every app loading without console errors.
- Several sessions work in this repository: commit only these files and hunks; leave findings for other plans in
  their To do.
